# contrib/

This folder contains contributions that may be useful to users of this library, but
have a too specialized audience to become part of the main tree.

In particular, things in here will have a higher rate of bit-rot, since
contributors are not required to and may be unable to check whether their
changes break any of them.

## Windows support
Tested on the following environment
* Windows 10 - 64bit
* Anaconda 4.3 (64 bit)
* Python 3.6.0
* CMake 3.9.4
* Visual Studio 2017, 2015, 2013

### Configuring and Building Samples
1. Edit WinBuild.cmd for your environment(Line:5-7)
    if NOT DEFINED MSVC_VERSION set MSVC_VERSION=[Your Visual Studio Version(12, 14, 15)]
    if NOT DEFINED CMAKE_CONFIG set CMAKE_CONFIG=Release
    if NOT DEFINED PYTHONHOME   set PYTHONHOME=[Your Python Path]

2. Run WinBuild.cmd to build
```cmd
> cd contrib
> WinBuild.cmd
```
The `WinBuild.cmd` will set up temporal ENV variables and build binaries in (matplotlib root)/examples with the Release configuration.

3. Find exe files in examples/build/Release
Note: platforms folder is necessary to make qt works.

## Unit Tests

```cmd
> cd contrib/unittests_catch2
> cmake -S . -B "./build"
> cd build
> make
> ./run_MatplotlibcppTests
```
See `unittests_catch/2README` for more details.
